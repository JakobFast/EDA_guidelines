Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in the data analysis process, allowing you to understand your data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. Here is a general outline of the steps to perform EDA in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn:

1. Import libraries and load data
2. Inspect data structure and summary statistics
3. Handle missing and duplicate data
4. Perform data type conversions if necessary
5. Analyze distributions of numerical variables
6. Analyze relationships between numerical variables
7. Analyze categorical variables
8. Analyze relationships between categorical and numerical variables
9. Perform feature engineering if necessary
10. Save the cleaned and processed data for further analysis or modeling

Once you have a general understanding of these steps, you can dive deeper into each step with examples and explanations.
